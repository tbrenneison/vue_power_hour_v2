# Welcome to the Vue.js Power Hour README

This project has several branches that can be viewed sequentially, in the same order that things are completed in the conference talk.

1. main
    - contains a project scaffolded from running npm create vue@latest
2. empty_project
    - contains an empty project with just the "title slide" for the talk ("hellpVph.vue")  
3. add_first_component
    - contains the first "TodoList.vue" component
4. split_components
    - splits the todo form into its own component
5. use_pinia_store
    - moves state and logic from the components into a Pinia options store
6. add_css 
    - magically makes everything pretty 
7. support_multiple_cats 
    - switch between Zenith's and Philco's to-do lists
